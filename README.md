**Calculator Application using CustomTkinter**

**Overview**
      This project is a straightforward calculator application created using Python's `CustomTkinter` library. The calculator supports fundamental arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithmic calculations, and more. The graphical user interface (GUI) is crafted with a sleek, modern design, featuring custom color schemes and button styles.

**Features**
        1- Basic Arithmetic Operations:
                                  Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
        2- Trigonometric Functions:
                                  Compute sine, cosine, and tangent values (in degrees).
        3- Logarithmic Calculation:
                                  Calculate the logarithm with base 2.
        4- Power Functions:
                                  Includes square and square root, as well as cube root.
        5- Error Handling:
                                  Provides alerts for syntax errors and division by zero errors.
        6- Memory Functions:
                                  Offers features like clearing the entry and backspace for corrections.

**Dependencies/ Library Used:**
      `customtkinter`: A modern, customizable variant of Tkinter for Python.

**Installation**
      1. Install the necessary library:
 pip install customtkinter

**How to Use**
      1. **Numeric Input**: Click the numeric buttons to input numbers.
      2. **Arithmetic Operations**: Use `+`, `-`, `x`, `/` for basic operations.
      3. **Trigonometric Functions**: Use `sin(θ)`, `cos(θ)`, `tan(θ)` for trigonometric calculations.
      4. **Special Functions**: 
                  `x²` to square a number.
                  `√` for square root.
                  `³√` for cube root.
                  `log2` for logarithm with base 2.
      5. **Error Handling**: The application displays a message box for errors such as incorrect syntax or division by zero.
      6. **Result**: Click `=` to show the calculated result.

**Customization**

      The color schemes, button text, and layout can be easily customized by adjusting the parameters 
      in the `customtkinter.CTkButton` and `customtkinter.CTkEntry` widgets.

**Future Enhancements**
      Introducing more advanced mathematical functions.
      Implementing a memory storage feature.
      Enhancing the GUI for an improved user experience.

This project serves as a great way to learn and practice Python GUI development using CustomTkinter.
